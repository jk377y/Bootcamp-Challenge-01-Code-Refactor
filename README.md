# Code Refactor Starter Code


## Description
The Horiseon Home Page is not functioning 100% correctly. There is evidence of broken links, extra code that could be consolidated into a cleaner and shorter format, incorrect and inconsistent element tagging and some linitation on the accessibility features.

My goal is to solve these issues and provide correctly commented changes where applicable. I will do this by the use of several tools at my disposal. I will compare the current code to previous code I have seen in the past and in examples used in class. I will visually inspect for incorrect formatting or repeated code. Once my own assessment is completed, I will run the code through a .html validator at https://validator.w3.org/ for any final adjustments.
